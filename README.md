# Introduction

This is a sample app that shows five unique, interesting flights to destinations you can visit with Kiwi.com on a daily basis. That is, if your sample app presents some selection of routes (f.e. PRG→JFK, ORY→SFO, ...) between destinations on Day 1, these exact routes won’t be offered again on a different day, and so on.

It uses the Kiwi.com Umbrella API to either list or search available Places and search for respective Flights based on your request.

# Development Steps

Below, you will find the list of steps that I followed to do that job. They match the commits in the git directory so you can review step by step if needed.
Write an introduction on the readme file.

1. **Readme file**: Write an introduction on the readme file.
2. **Project + Feature UI initial version**. Creating a SwiftUI-based Xcode project and doing the initial implementation of the UI. This implementation is unpolished and uses dummy data.
